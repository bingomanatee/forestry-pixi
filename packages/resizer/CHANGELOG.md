# CHANGELOG

## 1.0 

Got basic delaying of update to tie into the PIXI Ticker class's metabolism

## 1.0.1 

To diminish pixi-dependence, we are using a specific optional ticker parameter
to control the refresh timing.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-02-27

- Instituted a deeper style-key pattern using dot-separated noun parts, with interCaps compatibility in style-tree.
- Raised the Node runtime baseline to `>=20.0.0`.
